# applied modeling techinques
 
This repo will contain several examples of how to implement various machine learning
models.  This will be a record of my learning as I complete projects using several
types of models.  

## planned model types
* regressions
* natural language processing
* random forest
* neural networks
* naive bayes
* clustering

Where applicable several implementations of each model will be included.  

## planned tools

My learning should also include the tools commonly used with these model types

* python, including all of the mainstream ml packages
* r, including mainstream ml packages 
* cloud platforms including aws, gcp and azure
* parallel computing, starting with hadoop and branching into others

## model deliverables

Being able to communicate this work will be essential.  Each model built will include

* executive summary
* eli5 explanation of the algoritm
* eli5 explanation of what the model is and is not
* at least one visualization using several different packages

## disclaimer

As failures are learning opportunities both in what does and does not work as well
as how to determine when to abandon a method.  This project will likely contain several
incomplete and abandoned models.  

## out of scope

As is common with curious and engaged people, there will be temptation to expand or redefine
the project before the initial models are completed.  Some of the items that will not be included:

* any kind of administration on any of the tools
* overly complicated workflows or environments
* bloated docker images or vms used for single, small purposes

## updates

Weekly progress will be noted and discussed on my blog which has yet to be started.
